# Build a Machine Learning Web App for Binary Classification of Mushroom with Streamlit and Python
This interactive ML web application will allows users to choose what classification algorithm they want to use and let them interactively set hyper-parameter values, all without them knowing to code!
# This project Covers:

Build interactive web applications with Streamlit and Python

Train Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Classifiers using scikit-learn

Plot evaluation metrics for above binary classification algorithms
